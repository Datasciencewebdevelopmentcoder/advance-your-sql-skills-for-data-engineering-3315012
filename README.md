Are you looking for a better—and easier—way to manage SQL code? In this course, instructor Vinoo Ganesh shows you how to use dbt (data build tool) to operationalize SQL in powerful ways and make the process of transforming data simpler and faster.
In each chapter, Vinoo presents a real-world situation or problem, and provides focused code examples explaining how to solve the problem. He shows you how to design and implement dbt models to solve basic and advanced challenges, covering topics like schema design, generating SQL model files, table materializations, implementing CTEs, and SQL unit tests. Join Vinoo in this course to advance your SQL skills and make your code management easier.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
